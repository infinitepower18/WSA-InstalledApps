# WSA Installed apps
Add an easy shortcut on your Start Menu to bring up a list of apps installed on Windows Subsystem for Android. The list also shows you system apps that are not present on the start menu, such as Camera, Contacts and Settings.

## Download
Download the app from the [releases page](https://github.com/infinitepower18/WSA-InstalledApps/releases/latest) and sideload it into WSA. You can use [WSA Sideloader](https://github.com/infinitepower18/WSA-Sideloader) to simplify the process.
