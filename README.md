# WSA Installed apps
This app simply launches the app list in WSA's Android settings app, enabling an easy shortcut on your Start Menu to bring up a list of apps installed on Windows Subsystem for Android.

## Download
Download the app from the releases page and sideload it into WSA. You can use [WSA Sideloader](https://github.com/infinitepower18/WSA-Sideloader) to simplify the process.
